## 1. How did the July Movement escalate from a quota reform protest to a mass uprising? What were its consequences? *(6 marks)*

The July Movement of 2018 in Bangladesh began as a student-led protest against the existing quota system in government recruitment. At the time, 56% of government jobs were reserved for various groups, including 30% for descendants of freedom fighters, 10% for women, 10% for underprivileged districts, and 5% for ethnic minorities. Students from public universities across the country argued that this system undermined meritocracy and disadvantaged qualified candidates.

Initially, the protests were peaceful and focused solely on reforming the quota system. However, tensions escalated when law enforcement agencies responded with force—using tear gas, rubber bullets, and baton charges against demonstrators. This crackdown, coupled with the government's delayed and ambiguous response, ignited widespread outrage. Social media played a critical role in amplifying the movement, allowing students to share real-time updates, mobilize support, and expose police brutality.

As more students joined, the movement evolved beyond quota reform. It became a broader expression of frustration with systemic corruption, lack of transparency, and generational inequality. The protest transformed into a mass uprising, drawing support from civil society, educators, and even some political figures.

**Consequences of the July Movement:**
- The government announced the abolition of the quota system for Class I and II jobs, though implementation remained inconsistent.
- The movement reignited student activism in Bangladesh, reminiscent of the 1969 and 1990 uprisings.
- It exposed deep-rooted issues in governance and public trust, prompting calls for broader reforms.
- The crackdown and surveillance of student leaders raised concerns about freedom of expression and democratic rights.

## 2. Briefly discuss the economic success of the interim government after the July uprising. *(7 marks)*

Following the July uprising, the government faced pressure to stabilize the political climate and reassure both domestic and international stakeholders. While there wasn’t a formal “interim government” in the constitutional sense, the administration undertook several measures to restore confidence and maintain economic momentum.

**Key economic initiatives included:**
- **Investor reassurance:** The government engaged with foreign investors and diplomatic missions to affirm that political unrest would not disrupt business operations. This helped maintain foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.
- **Infrastructure acceleration:** Projects like the Padma Bridge, Dhaka Metro Rail, and Karnaphuli Tunnel were fast-tracked to showcase development progress and economic resilience.
- **Digital financial inclusion:** Mobile banking and digital payment systems were expanded, increasing access to financial services for rural and underserved populations.
- **Export sector support:** Special incentives were provided to the ready-made garments (RMG) sector, which accounts for over 80% of Bangladesh’s export earnings. This included tax breaks, easier access to credit, and streamlined customs procedures.

**Economic outcomes:**
- Despite political tensions, Bangladesh’s GDP growth remained strong, hovering around 7.8%.
- Foreign exchange reserves increased, reflecting confidence in the macroeconomic framework.
- Remittance inflows from overseas workers remained robust, contributing to rural consumption and poverty reduction.
- The government’s ability to maintain economic stability amid social unrest demonstrated institutional resilience and policy continuity.

## 3. How did the mass upsurge of 1969 inspire our people to take part in the liberation war? *(7 marks)*

The mass upsurge of 1969 was a defining moment in the history of Bangladesh. It marked the culmination of years of political dissatisfaction, economic disparity, and cultural suppression under the rule of West Pakistan. The movement was led primarily by students and workers, who demanded the resignation of President Ayub Khan and the restoration of democratic rights.

The uprising was fueled by grievances such as:
- Economic exploitation of East Pakistan despite its contribution to national revenue.
- Cultural marginalization, including the imposition of Urdu over Bengali.
- Political disenfranchisement, with East Pakistan receiving fewer seats and less representation.

The protests quickly spread across cities and towns, uniting people from all walks of life. The movement succeeded in forcing Ayub Khan to resign and paved the way for General Yahya Khan to take over. More importantly, it led to the withdrawal of the Agartala Conspiracy Case and the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who emerged as the undisputed leader of the Bengali people.

**Inspiration for the Liberation War:**
- The 1969 uprising instilled a sense of collective empowerment. People realized that mass mobilization could challenge authoritarian rule.
- It politicized a generation of youth who later became freedom fighters in 1971.
- The movement laid the ideological foundation for autonomy and self-determination, which were central to the liberation struggle.
- The unity and courage displayed in 1969 became a blueprint for the resistance against the Pakistani military during the war.

In essence, the mass upsurge of 1969 was not just a protest—it was a rehearsal for independence. It awakened national consciousness and gave Bengalis the confidence to fight for their identity, rights, and sovereignty.
